| <img src="vignettes/imhen.png" alt="" style="width: 100px;"/> | This package contains meteorological data for Vietnam from the Vietnamese Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Environment  ([IMHEN](http://vnclimate.vn/en/about/imhen/)). This is monthly data in 67 climatic stations from January 1960 to December 2015. Climatic variables are min, max, average temperatures, absolute and relative humidities, rainfall and hours of sunshine. |

## Installation and loading

You can install `imhen` from [GitHub](https://github.com/epix-project/imhen)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("epix-project/imhen", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Once installed, you can load the package:

```{r}
library(imhen)
```

## Usage examples

The package contains two dataframes. The first one is `meteo` which contains the
climatic variables `Tx`, `Ta`, `Tm`, `aH`, `rH`, `Rf` and `Sh` plus time (`year`
and `month`) and space (`station`) information:

```{r}
head(meteo)
```

Note that the data frame is not "complete", with some combinations of the `year`,
`month` and `station` being missing:

```{r}
table(with(meteo, table(year, month, station)))
```

The second one is `stations` which contains the coordinates (`longitude` and
`latitude`) and the `elevation`:

```{r}
head(stations)
```

### Mapping the climatic stations

We can transform the climatic stations coordinates into a spatial object:

```{r eval=F}
library(gadmVN)
vietnam <- gadm(level = "country")
coordinates(stations) <- ~ longitude + latitude
proj4string(stations) <- vietnam@proj4string
```

And plot the stations on the map:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(vietnam, col = "grey")
points(stations, col = "blue", pch = 3)
```

### Visualizing the climatic stations elevations

We can also look at the elevations of the climatic stations:

```{r}
plot(sort(stations$elevation, TRUE), type = "o",
     xlab = "stations ranked by decreasing elevation", ylab = "elevation (m)")
```

### Exploring the climatic variables

Let's look at the temperatures:

```{r fig.height = .5 * 3.5, fig.width = 1.3 * 4.24725}
val <- c("Tm", "Ta", "Tx")
T_range <- range(meteo[, val], na.rm = TRUE)
breaks <- seq(floor(T_range[1]), ceiling(T_range[2]), 2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
for(i in val)
  hist(meteo[[i]], breaks, ann = FALSE, col = "lightgrey", ylim = c(0, 10500))
```

Looks good. Let's check the consistency of the values:

```{r}
for(i in val) print(range(meteo[[i]], na.rm = TRUE))
with(meteo, any(!((Tm <= Ta) & (Ta <= Tx)), na.rm = TRUE))
```

Let's look at the other variables:

```{r}
val <- c("aH", "rH", "Rf", "Sh")
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
for(i in val) hist(meteo[[i]], col = "lightgrey", ann = FALSE)
```

Looks good too.

```{r}
for(i in val) print(range(meteo[[i]], na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Visualizing the data spatio-temporally

Let's first Make a `year`, `month`, `station` template for a full design of the
data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
y <- sort(unique(meteo$year))
m <- factor(levels(meteo$month), levels(meteo$month), ordered = TRUE)
s <- stations$station[order(coordinates(stations)[, "latitude"])]
s <- factor(s, s, ordered = TRUE)
template <- setNames(expand.grid(y, m, s), c("year", "month", "station"))
attr(template, "out.attrs") <- NULL  # removing useless attributes
```

The full version of the data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
meteo_full <- merge(template, meteo, all.x = TRUE)
```

Let's visualize it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- as.Date(with(unique(meteo_full[, c("year", "month")]),
                  paste0(year, "-", as.numeric(month), "-15")))
y <- seq_along(stations)
nb <- length(y)
col <- rev(heat.colors(12))
show_data <- function(var) {
  image(x, y, t(matrix(meteo_full[[var]], nb)), col = col,
        xlab = NA, ylab = "climatic stations")
  box(bty = "o")
}
```

Missings values for all the temperature variables:

```{r eval=FALSE}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
for(i in c("Tx", "Ta", "Tm")) show_data(i)
par(opar)
```

Showing very well the higher seasonality in the north than in the south. Missing
values for the absolute and relative humidities as well as for rainfall and
hours of sunshine:

```{r eval=FALSE}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
for(i in c("aH", "rH", "Rf", "Sh")) show_data(i)
par(opar)
```

Showing strong seasonality of absolute humidity in the north of the country,
interesting pattern of relative humidity in the center of the country, high
rainfalls in the fall in the center of the country, and out-of-phase 
oscillations of the number of hours of sunshine between the north and the south
of the country. It seems though that there are strange outliers in sunshine in
the north in 2008 or so. Let's now combine the missing values from all the
climatic variables:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
meteo_full %<>% mutate(combined = is.na(Tx + Ta + Tm + aH + rH + Rf + Sh))
show_data("combined")
abline(v = as.Date("1995-01-01"))
```

The locations of the 6 stations with missing value in the recent year are:

```{r eval=FALSE}
subset(meteo_full, year > 1994 & combined, station, TRUE) %>% unique
```

## Left to do

- pairwise distances
- time series (trends seasonalities)
- time seasonal variation
- PCA?
